# EPIC: Checkpoint Vardi

## Purpose

This file is the high-level container for the local story system. It should describe the active
epic's scope, guardrails, and sequencing once real stories are added.

## Current State

- the story system exists locally under `user_stories/`
- `S0-01` is complete and now lives under `done/`
- no next implementation story is staged yet
- the maintenance workflow is defined by `$vardi-story-management`

## How To Use This Epic

The active stage is currently:

- **S0 - Foundations**
- Most recently completed story: `S0-01 - Foundations: runnable empty scaffold`
- Story file: `user_stories/epics/checkpoint_vardi/done/S0-01-foundations-scaffold.md`
- Next story: not yet staged

Any agent changing story state must update `TRACKER.md`, `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, `EPIC.md`, and the
story file or folder in the same change. Invoke `$vardi-story-management`.

## Active Stage

### S0 - Foundations

`S0-01` completed the narrow baseline step: take the scaffold from "files on disk" to
"runnable empty project" without widening into feature work, schema work, or product behavior.

This baseline now gives later stories a trustworthy install, lint, typecheck, test, build, and
dev-server loop. The next story has not yet been staged in the epic tracker.

## Guardrails

- Keep this file at the epic level, not the task level.
- Put implementation details in the story file, not here.
- If a story changes status, keep this file aligned with the tracker and execution plan.
- Do not seed speculative backlog items here unless the user explicitly asks for them.
